# Concurrent Programming course introduction

## Goals

In summary, provide the knowledge and skills required to design and implement applications over multi-threaded and asynchronous programming models, with emphasis on the concurrency and coordination aspects.

See [_ficha de unidade curricular_](https://www.isel.pt/sites/default/files/FUC_LEIC/4sem/PC_LEIC.pdf).

## Programme

- Introduction to multi-threaded models and concurrent programming.
- Design of custom synchronizers using monitors on the JVM platform.
- Memory models and lock-free algorithms and data structures.
- Asynchronous I/O and asynchronous programming models on the JVM platform and the Kotlin language.

See [calendar.md](../calendar.md) for a more detailed programme, including *relevant dates*.

## Evaluation

See [Moodle](https://2223moodle.isel.pt/course/view.php?id=6715).

The exercise sets are delivered via Git repositories hosted on the [https://github.com/isel-leic-pc](https://github.com/isel-leic-pc) GitHub organization.
