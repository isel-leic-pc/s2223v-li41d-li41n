# Concurrent Programming course introduction

## Goals

In summary, provide the knowledge and skills required to design and implement applications over multi-threaded and asynchronous programming models, with emphasis on the concurrency and coordination aspects.

See link:https://www.isel.pt/sites/default/files/FUC_LEIC/4sem/PC_LEIC.pdf[_ficha de unidade curricular_].

## Programme

- Introduction to multi-threaded models and concurrent programming.
- Design of custom synchronizers using monitors on the JVM platform.
- Memory models and lock-free algorithms and data structures.
- Asynchronous I/O and asynchronous programming models on the JVM platform and the Kotlin language.

See link:../calendar.md[calendar] for a more detailed programme, including *relevant dates*.

## Evaluation

* Final test on the exam dates.
** Minimum classification is 8,0.
** Can attend both exam dates.
* Three _exercise sets_.
** First and second sets must be done individually.
** Third set can be done undividually or in group of at most 3 elements.
** The exercise sets are delivered via Git repositories hosted on the https://github.com/isel-leic-pc GitHub organization. 

See https://2223moodle.isel.pt/course/view.php?id=6715[Moodle] for more details about the evaluation process, namely how is the final grade is computed.
