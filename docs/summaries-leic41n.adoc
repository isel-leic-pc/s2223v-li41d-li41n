=== Lecture 2: 2023-03-02

* Introduction to the JVM threading model.
** Motivation: a echo TCP/IP server capable of handling multiple connected clients.
*** Handling a single client at a time.
*** Handling multiple clients simultaneously.
*** See link:../jvm/src/main/kotlin/pt/isel/pc/sketches/leic41n/lecture2[EchoServer sketch].

** Thread APIs in the JVM.
*** Thread creation.
*** Synchronization with thread termination.

** Creating unit tests using multiple threads.
*** Non-deterministic behavior.
*** Thread termination synchronization.
*** See link:../jvm/src/test/kotlin/pt/isel/pc/sketches/leic41n/lecture2[Test sketches].

* Sharing mutable data between multiple threads.
** Identification of when sharing exists.
** Data sharing hazards.
** Avoiding data sharing hazards by avoiding the data sharing.
*** *Confining* the data access to a single thread.

== Week 2

=== Lecture 3: 2023-03-06

* How to have two thread running simultaneously using two CPUs, sharing the same memory.
** Characterization of the _code_, _stack_, _data_ memory blocks.
*** _code_ - read-only, shared between threads.
*** _stack_ - read-write, exclusive for each thread.
*** _data_ - read-write, shared between threads.

* How to have more threads than CPUs, by using time multiplexing of threads into processors.
*** The _context switch_ concept.

* The main states of a thread and the transition between thems.
** The _ready_ and _running_ states.
*** The _ready queue_ has the container for all threads in the _ready_ state.
** The _not-ready_ state and the concept of non-busy waiting ("espera passiva").
** The _not-started_ and _finished_ states.

* The _scheduler_ concept.
** Examples of _scheduling_ policies.
** _Cooperative_ scheduling versus _preemptive_ scheduling.

* Study of the `uthreads` pedagogical multi-threading cooperative user-mode system.
** The design and implementation of the `context_switch` function.

=== Lecture 4: 2023-03-09

* Continuing with the study of the `uthreads` system.
** Review the design and implementation of the `context_switch` function.
** Thread creation and termination.
** Thread scheduling.
** Adding thread join coordination to the `uthreads` system as a way to illustrate the _not-ready_ state and the transition into and from this state.

* See link:lecture-notes/4-uthreads.adoc[`uthreads` - User Mode Cooperative Threads].

== Week 3

=== Lecture 3: 2023-03-13

* Continuing with the `uthreads` pedagogical multi-threading cooperative user-mode system.
** Control synchronization and the implementation of `ut_join` - synchronization with thread termination.
** See link:../native/uthreads-with-join[`uthreads-with-join`]

* Data synchronization
** Concurrency hazards when sharing mutable data between multiple threads.
** Data synchronization using mutual exclusion, implemented via locks.
** The JVM https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html[`Lock` interface] and the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantLock.html[`ReentrantLock` class].

=== Lecture 4: 2023-03-16

* Continuing with data synchronization.
** Identifying data sharing between multiple threads. Using the _echo server_ application has an example.
** The JVM https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html[`Lock` interface] and the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantLock.html[`ReentrantLock` class].
** Implementation of a lock-based counter and usage on the _echo server_ application.

* Control synchronization
** Example: limiting the number of handled connections on the _echo server_ application, implemented by waiting for the number of handled connections to be below the maximum before calling `accept` to accept a new connection.
** The _synchronizer_ concept as a way to centralize control synchronization logic.
** The _monitor_ concept, as a building block for the construction of custom synchronizers by providing a coordinated mechanism for both data synchronization and control synchronization.
** Implementation of a simple unary semaphore using conditions, without support for timeouts nor fairness.
