=== Lecture 2: 2023-01-02

* Introduction to the JVM threading model.
** Motivation: a echo TCP/IP server capable of handling multiple connected clients.
*** Handling a single client at a time.
*** Handling multiple clients simultaneously.
*** See link:../jvm/src/main/kotlin/pt/isel/pc/sketches/leic41d/lecture2[EchoServer sketch].

** Thread APIs in the JVM.
*** Thread creation.
*** Synchronization with thread termination.

** Creating unit tests using multiple threads.
*** Non-deterministic behavior.
*** Thread termination synchronization.
*** See link:../jvm/src/test/kotlin/pt/isel/pc/sketches/leic41d/lecture2[Test sketches].

* Sharing mutable data between multiple threads.
** Identification of when sharing exists.
** Data sharing hazards.
** Avoiding data sharing hazards by avoiding the data sharing.
*** *Confining* the data access to a single thread.
